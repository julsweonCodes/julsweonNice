    Review A1 requirements
    
     - initiate pokemon instances each battle
     - manage battle (battle manager)
     - randomness — using seed
     - controlling pokemon’s actions -> defend or attack
     - select next attack or defence skill
     - attack or defend based on currHitPoints/maxHitPoints
     - select attack / defend skill randomly based on seed value (-> seed value)

    💡
    
    Readability
    
    - **Cluttered & Disorganized Layout:** Some association lines are too long, making relationships hard to follow.
    - **Variable Naming Issues:** Names like `classMap`, `loadConfig()`, `p1`, and `p2` could be clearer.
    - **Formatting Errors:** UML attributes should follow the "name: Type" format but are inconsistent.
    - **PokemonType Enum Layout:** Listing values horizontally makes them difficult to read.

    💡
    
    Validity
    
    - **Misplaced Methods & Responsibilities:**
        - `applyDamage()` and `reduceDamage()` in `AttackSkill` and `DefenseSkill` should **move to the Pokemon class** for better cohesion.
        - `calculateEffectiveDamage()` in `BattleManager` might belong in **Pokemon** instead.
    - **Unnecessary Factory Class:**
        - `PokemonFactory` was criticized as **over-engineered**. Instead of passing `PokemonType`, a **Pokemon name should be passed** to create instances.
    - **Battle Attributes Issue:**
        - `attacker` and `defender` attributes should be **generalized** (e.g., `pokemon1` and `pokemon2`) since they switch roles.
    - **Stack Usage for MovesPerformed:**
        - Keeping track of all previous moves **is unnecessary**—only the last move matters for damage calculation.
    - **Random Class Inconsistency:**
        - The `Random` class appears in some diagrams but is **not consistently integrated**.
    </aside>

    💡
    
    Fluidity
    
    - **Extra Information Not in the Problem Statement:**
        - The **PokemonType enum** includes more than required—should have been left **open-ended**.
        - **PokemonFactory may be unnecessary** if Pokémon creation logic can be handled differently.
    - **Class Redundancies:**
        - `DefenseSkill` and `AttackSkill` could be merged into a **single class** with a boolean or type attribute.
    - **Sequence Diagram Inconsistencies:**
        - The **first sequence diagram includes PokemonFactory, but the second does not**, making its role unclear.
    - **Missing Multiplicity in Class Relationships:**
        - The diagram lacks cardinalities (**e.g., how many Skills a Pokémon can have**).
    - **Composition vs Aggregation:**
        - Attack and Defense skills should use **aggregation (empty diamond) instead of composition (filled diamond)** because skills **can be shared across Pokémon**.

    Other comments
    
    - **Dashed lines should be used for "uses" dependencies** instead of solid lines.
    - `has` labels on aggregation and composition relationships **are redundant** and should be removed.
    - **Multiplicity should be explicitly stated** (e.g., `1..*`, `0..*`).
    - **Method names in sequence diagrams must match the class diagram** (some methods were missing).
    - **BattleManager and Pokémon instances were labeled as "user" icons instead of objects**.
    
    - Straighten and shorten association lines.
    - Use **better variable names** (avoid `p1`, `p2`, `classMap`).
    - Format attributes correctly (`name: Type`).
    - Move `applyDamage()` and `reduceDamage()` into `Pokemon` instead of `Skill` classes.
    - Consider **removing** `PokemonFactory` or restructuring it.
    - **Merge** `DefenseSkill` and `AttackSkill`.
    - Use **dashed lines for dependencies**.
    - Add **multiplicity** (`1..*`, `0..*`).
    - Fix **composition vs aggregation** (Skills should be aggregation).
    - Ensure **sequence diagrams match class diagrams**.
    - Clarify Battle Flow
        - Change **`attacker/defender`** to `pokemon1/pokemon2`.
        - Store **only the last move instead of an entire move stack**.

    Tournament Test Case WalkThrough
    
    ⭐️ Backend
    
    1. Tournament implementation (**must be added to updated diagrams)
    - input: list of pokémon (-> length of pokémon list)
    - output: tournament order
    2. Seed methods — setseed, removeseed
    3. Battle methods — battle(start battle), stop (stop battle)
    
    ⭐️ Command
    
    > battle, Bulbasaur, Pikachu
    
    // battle between Bulbasaur and Pikachu
    
    // Bulbasaur -> Pikachu and rest of the battle is conducted automatically using random numbers until the battle is ended (one pokemon’s hit points reach 0

    ## Meeting Recap 3/18/25 7-8PM ET
    
    ### **Finalized Design Decision Outcomes**
    
    - **ADR update 1:** Replacing Svelte with NextJS because it’s way more industry relevant and modular 🙂.
    - Pending Group Discussion Outcomes will become finalized after we vote and align, mainly on #1 below, since we’ve aligned on our db, ui in former syncs.
    
    **Pending Design Discussion Outcomes**
    
    1. We discussed using a node based client API using `Primsa` (or similar `NextJS friendly`) ORM instead of using a Java Spring Boot API
        - Benefits discussed were the ease of integration with the front-end, and persistence layer (PostgreSQL)
        - Docker layering ease due to the small bundle size
        - Scalability, performance, server-side rending functionality, industry standard in terms of top 5 front-end frameworks
